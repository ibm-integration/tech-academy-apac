## Lab Overview

The most interesting and impactful new applications in an enterprise are those that provide interactive experiences by reacting to existing systems carrying out a business function. In this tutorial, we take a look at an example. 

This session explains what configuration is needed to deploy an Integration Flow developed with ACE Toolkit that uses the Kafka Nodes to connect to an Event Streams cluster using the latest version of the ACE Integration Server Certified Container (ACEcc) as part of the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.

Lab's takeways:
  - Creating and Configuring an EventStreams Topic
  - Configure App Connect Enterprise message flow using App Connect Enterprise toolkit
  - Configuring App Connect Enterprise service
  - Deploying App Connect BAR file on App Connect Enterprise Server
  - Testing App Connect Enterprise API sending a message to EventStreams

***

## Prerequisites

- You need to have an OpenShift environment with CP4I. For this session, your proctor will provide you a pre-installed environment, with admin access (more details below). If you want to create your personal environment, you can request an environment on IBM TechZone.
- You should have an MQ Queue Manager runtime pre-created in your CP4I on ROKS environment.
- You need to have the IBM App Connect Enterprise Toolkit installed in your desktop. Follow the sections Download IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers and Install IBM App Connect Enterprise from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/11.0.0?topic=started-get-hands-experience" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to install it.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 18](images/2021-09-18_20-17-49.png)

12. Before we move to ACE we will need to convert the certificate format from PKCS12 to JKS. Open a ***Terminal*** and navigate to the location where you stored the certificate in *step 8* and run the following command changing the *cert-password* value for the actual password you got in setp 10.

```
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore es-cert.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore es-cert.jks  -deststoretype JKS -srcstorepass <cert-password> -deststorepass <cert-password> -srcalias ca.crt -destalias ca.crt -noprompt
```

Now we are ready to move to ACE and create the required configuration using the information we have collected.

***

## 3 - Create Resources in the ACE Toolkit

For this lab I have created a simple project that exposes an API to POST information into a Kafka topic.
The following picture shows the corresponding flow. Go ahead and download the Project Interchange [here](https://github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/tinkering-cp4i/blob/master/ACE/PIs/JGRESAPISCRAM.zip). Then, import the project using the **File > Import > Project Interchange** option.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 19](images/2021-09-19_06-39-06.png)

First we will create a ***Policy Project*** to store the Event Streams configuration.

1. From the ***Application Development*** pane click on ***New** and select ***Policy Project***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 20](images/2021-09-19_06-53-07.png)

2. In the pop-up window enter the name of the project, i.e. ***CP4IESDEMOSCRAM*** and click ***Finish***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 21](images/2021-09-19_06-57-19.png)

3. The project appears in the ***Application Development*** pane. Expand the project and click ***(New...)***. Then select ***Policy*** from the ***New Artifact*** menu.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 22](images/2021-09-19_07-04-21.png)

4. In the pop-up window enter the name of the policy, i.e. ***es-demo*** and click ***Finish***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 23](images/2021-09-19_07-08-08.png)

5. The ***Policy Editor** opens to enter the data. Click on the ***Type*** drop down box and select ***Kafka***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 24](images/2021-09-19_07-12-10.png)

The default values from the ***Kafka Template*** are used to pre-populate the policy.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 25](images/2021-09-19_07-16-01.png)

6. Update the policy using the following values:

Property | Value
---------|-------
Bootstrap servers | &lt;Value copied from previos section>
Security protocol | ***SASL_SSL***
SASL Mechanism | ***SCRAM-SHA-512***
SSL protocol | ***TLSv1.2***
Security identity (DSN) | any value, i.e. ***aceflowsSecId***
SASL config | ***org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required;***
SSL truststore location | ***/home/aceuser/truststores/es-cert.jks***
SSL truststore type | ***JKS***
SSL truststore security identity | ***truststorePass***
Enable SSL certificate hostname checking | ***false***

The policy should look similar to this:

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 26](images/2021-12-21_18-52-22.png)

7. Don't forget to ***Save*** your changes.

8. Go back to the ***Flow Editor** to update the flow. Select the ***KafkaProducer*** node and update the properties in the ***Basic*** tab. Use the following information as a reference:

Property | Value
---------|-------
Topic name | &lt;Value used in the first section> i.e. ***kafka-cp4i-demo-topic***
Bootstrap servers | We have configured this value in the policy, but since this is a mandatory field we will enter ***dummy***
Client ID | any value, i.e. ***cp4iace-esapi-scram***

The tab should look similar to this:

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 27](images/2021-09-19_07-37-59.png)

9. Select the ***Policy*** tab and in the window click ***Browse***. From the pop-up window select the policty we just created and click ***OK***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 28](images/2021-09-19_07-48-42.png)

10. The policy with be displayed in the ***Policy** field. Save your project to get rid of the error message.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 29](images/2021-09-19_07-52-53.png)

11. Now we will create the BAR file to deploy our flow. Navigate to the ***File** menu and select ***New** and then ***BAR file***

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 30](images/2021-09-19_07-59-00.png)

12. In the pop-up window enter the name of the BAR file, i.e. ***jgr-cp4i-esapi-scram*** and click ***Finish***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 30](images/2021-09-19_08-02-24.png)

13. The ***BAR Editor*** is open. Select ***Applications, shared libraries, services, REST APIs, and Test Projects*** to display the right type of resources and then select your application, in this case ***JGRESAPISCRAM***. Finally click ***Build and Save...*** to create the BAR file.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 31](images/2021-09-19_08-04-43.png)

14. You can dismiss the notification window reporting the result clicking ***OK***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 32](images/2021-09-19_08-11-35.png)

15. Before we head to the **ACE Dashboard** we need to do a final step. We need to create a zip file from the *Policy Project* we created earlier in this section. For that you need to navigate to the folder where your **ACE Toolkit** workspace is located (in my case that use Mac it is located at /Users/&lt;your user>/IBM/ACET12/&lt;you workspace>) and use your tool of choice to compress the folder where the policy project is located. The following picture shows a possible option.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 33](images/2021-09-19_08-24-49.png)

16. Take a note where the zip file is located because we will use it in the next section.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 34](images/2021-09-19_08-26-38.png)

Now we can move to the next phase.

7. Finally click ***Create*** to add the TrustStore Configuration.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 25](images/2021-12-22_05-45-46.png)

8. Now we will define the Configuration to store the credentials selecting the ***setdbparms.txt*** type from the drop down box.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 26](images/2021-09-18_13-47-42.png)

9. In the next window enter the name of the configuration. In my case I used ***cp4i-esdemo-scram-credentials***. Followed by a brief description i.e. ***Credential to connect to es-demo using SCRAM***. Finally use the following information as a reference to enter the data in the text box.

Resource Name | User | Password
--------------|------|---------
***truststore::truststorePass*** | dummy | &lt;Password obtained in step 10 of section "Create SCRAM credentials to connect to Event Streams">
***kafka::aceflowsSecId*** | &lt;Name of user created in step 3 of section "Create SCRAM credentials to connect to Event Streams", i.e. ***ace-es-user-scram***> | &lt;Password obtained in step 7 of section "Create SCRAM credentials to connect to Event Streams">

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 26](images/2021-09-19_06-07-46.png)

10. Now we will create the Configuration for the Policy selecting the ***Policy project*** type from the drop down box.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 27](images/2021-09-19_08-33-56.png)

11. In the next window enter the name of the configuration, i.e ***jgr-es-demo-scram-policy**, a brief description if you want to, i.e. ***Policy to connect to Event Streams instance es-demo using SCRAM*** and finally click on hyper link ***Drag and drop a single file here or click to import*** to import the zip file we created in the previous section.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 28](images/2021-09-19_08-37-09.png)

10. In the next page give your deployment a name, i.e ***jgr-es-api-scram*** and open the ***YAML EDITOR***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 40](images/yaml-editor.png)

11. Because of a known issue in Integration Server v12.0.5 with Kafka Nodes, we will use a previous version of the Integration Server. Let's do it!

    Change the **license** value to **L-APEH-C9NCK6** (A). And change the **version** value to **12.0.4.0-r2** (B). Then click **Create** (C).

![ACE Toolkit YAML Values](images/yaml-values.png)

12. After a moment you will be taken back to the Dashboard page where you will see a new tile with your **Integration Server** deployment name in ***Pending*** state, similar to the picture shown below:

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 41](images/2021-09-19_11-47-40.png)

13. The **App Connect Dashboard** is deploying the **Integration Server** in the background creating the corresponding pod in the specificed **namespace** of the **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform**. This process can take more than a minute depending on your environment. Click the refresh button in your browser until you see the tile corresponding to your deployment in ***Ready*** state as shown below:

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 42](images/2021-09-19_12-21-31.png)

Now is time to test everything is working as expected. Click on the tile corresponding to your deployment.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 43](images/2021-09-19_12-25-00.png)

15. In the next page navigate to the operation implemented in your flow (***POST /contacts*** in my case). Then click on the ***Try it*** tab followed by the ***Generate*** hyperlink to generate some test data. Review the data generated and click the ***Send*** button.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 44](images/2021-09-19_12-44-47.png)

16. After a moment you will get a response back. If everything is OK you will receive a ***200*** response code indicating the request was successful and the same payload you sent plus some metadata including a timestamp showing the request completed few seconds ago.

    **NOTE:** Some people has reported issues at this stage that could be caused for the resources assigned to the **Integration Server** at deployment time. In this case, you can wait a little bit longer, like 3 or 4 more minutes, or you can redeploy the **Integration Server** increasing the *CPU* and *Memory* assigned to it.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 44](images/2021-09-19_12-48-15.png)

17. To fully confirm the message landed on the corresponding topic, you can navigate to the Event Streams instance and check the message is there. Once you are in the Event Streams Home page click on the ***Topics*** incon in the navigation section and then click on the topic you used in your flow. In my case ***kafka-cp4i-demo-topic***.

![ACE Toolkit integration with ES Configuration Step 45](images/2021-09-19_12-53-16.png)

18. In the topic page navigate to the ***Messages*** tab, then select the most recent message and confirm the payload includes the same data we sent during the test.
