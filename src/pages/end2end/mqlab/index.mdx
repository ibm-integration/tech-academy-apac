## Lab Overview

IBM MQ can transport any type of data as messages, enabling businesses to build flexible and reusable architectures. It works with a broad range of computing platforms, applications, web services and communications protocols for security-rich message delivery. IBM MQ provides a communications layer for visibility and control of the flow of messages and data inside and outside your organization.

This session explains the steps need to create an Integration Flow developed with ACE Toolkit that uses the REST API functionality as well as the MQ Nodes to interact with an MQ Queue Manager using the latest version of the ACE Integration Server Certified Container (ACEcc) as part of the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I).

Lab's takeways:
  - Creating an integration flow that connects to a message queue
  - Deploying the integration flow as a container in Kubernetes
  - Checking the message using MQ Web Console

***

## Prerequisites

- You need to have an OpenShift environment with CP4I. For this session, your proctor will provide you a pre-installed environment, with admin access (more details below). If you want to create your personal environment, you can request an environment on IBM TechZone.
- You should have an MQ Queue Manager runtime pre-created in your CP4I on ROKS environment.
- You need to have the IBM App Connect Enterprise Toolkit installed in your desktop. Follow the sections Download IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers and Install IBM App Connect Enterprise from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/11.0.0?topic=started-get-hands-experience" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to install it.
- You need to download the OpenAPI spec. Open this <a href="https://github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/cp4i-tech-jam/raw/main/artifacts/jgrmqapi.json" target="_blank">page</a> and save as swagger.json. You will use this spec later in the lab.

***

## Lab Environment

For this session you will use a ROKS 4.10 environment with Cloud Pak for Integration 2022.2. For this section, your lab proctors pre-installed this cluster for you with a pre-configured IBM MQ instance.

## 1 - Low Code / No Code Development with ACE Toolkit

1. Open the Toolkit in your workstation and create a new REST API project as shown below.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 1](images/2022-06-28_12-23-53.png)

2. Give a name to your project, i.e. *MQAPI* and then select the option to *Import resources* since we will leverage a definition already created.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 2](images/2022-06-28_12-25-32.png)

3. In the wizard click *Browse* and navigate to the location where the OpenAPI file definition is located.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 3](images/2022-06-28_12-26-19.png)

4. Once the path is displayed in the *Location* field click *Finish*.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 4](images/2022-06-28_12-28-17.png)

5. The REST API will be displayed, scroll to the right if needed to open the sunflow operation as shown in the image to proceed to implement the API logic.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 5](images/2022-06-28_12-31-05.png)

6. The *Message Flow Editor* will be open with only the *Input* and *Output* terminals. Double click the tab to maximize the editor and work with the flow.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 6](images/2022-06-28_12-32-33.png)

7. Drag and drop the *Nodes* from the palette to implemeng the "logic". In this case we will use the following nodes:
  * Flow Order Node,
  * HTTP Header Node,
  * MQ Header Node,
  * MQ Output Node, and
  * Mapping Node.

    And you will proceed to wire them. The flow should look like the one below. Once you are done double click the tab again in order to access the properties for each node.
![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 7](images/2022-06-28_12-37-45.png)

8. Now we will configure each node, starting with the *HTTP Header Node*. Click on it to bring it to focus and then select the *HTTP Input* tab followed by the *Delete header* option as shown below.

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 8](images/2022-06-28_12-40-26.png)

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 9](images/2022-06-28_13-01-52.png)

10. Then select the *MQ Output Node* and in the *Basic* tab enter the name of the queue we will use to put the messages, in this case *CP4I.DEMO.API.Q*

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 10](images/2022-06-28_13-04-48.png)

11. In the same *MQ Output Node* navigate to the *MQ Connection* tab enter the information to connect to the Queue Manager. The information is based on the configuration we used for MQ, and for simplicity is included below.

Property | Value
---------|-------
Connection | ***MQ client connection properties***
Destination queue manager name | ***QMGRDEMO***
Queue manager host name | ***qmgr-demo-ibm-mq***
Listener port number | ***1414***
Channel name | ***ACE.TO.MQ***

![ACE Toolkit REST API with MQ Step 11](images/2022-06-28_13-07-42.png)

12. Now double click the *Mapping Node*,
