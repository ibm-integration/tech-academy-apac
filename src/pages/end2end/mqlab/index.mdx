## Lab Overview

IBM MQ can transport any type of data as messages, enabling businesses to build flexible and reusable architectures. It works with a broad range of computing platforms, applications, web services and communications protocols for security-rich message delivery. IBM MQ provides a communications layer for visibility and control of the flow of messages and data inside and outside your organization.

This session explains the steps need to create an Integration Flow developed with ACE Toolkit that uses the REST API functionality as well as the MQ Nodes to interact with an MQ Queue Manager using the latest version of the ACE Integration Server Certified Container (ACEcc) as part of the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I).

Lab's takeways:
  - Creating an integration flow that connects to a message queue
  - Deploying the integration flow as a container in Kubernetes
  - Checking the message using MQ Web Console

***

## Prerequisites

- You need to have an OpenShift environment with CP4I. For this session, your proctor will provide you a pre-installed environment, with admin access (more details below). If you want to create your personal environment, you can request an environment on IBM TechZone.
- You should have an MQ Queue Manager runtime pre-created in your CP4I on ROKS environment.
- You need to have the IBM App Connect Enterprise Toolkit installed in your desktop. Follow the sections Download IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers and Install IBM App Connect Enterprise from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/11.0.0?topic=started-get-hands-experience" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to install it.

***

## Lab Environment

For this session you will use a ROKS 4.10 environment with Cloud Pak for Integration 2022.2. For this section, your lab proctors pre-installed this cluster for you with a pre-configured IBM MQ instance.

## 0 - Preparation

In this section you will do some initial steps to prepare your environment for the lab.

Next steps, assume that you already accepted the Account invitation in IBM Cloud (account: 2543884 - itztsglenablement05). This is the same account of GitOps lab. If you didn't accept, please check <a href="https://ibm-integration.github.io/tech-academy-apac/gitops/#0-preparation" target="_blank">the GitOps lab preparation section</a> to complete it. 

1. Log in <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM Cloud</a>.

2. In IBM Cloud dashboard, change your IBM Cloud account to **2543884 - itztsglenablement05**.

3. Now, click <a href="/tech-academy-apac/environments/" target="_blank">here</a> to open the **Team Environments** page.

4. Click to go to the **End-to-End Labs - Team Environments**.

7. Great, now let's check your Cloud Pak for Integration environment. First we need to get the Platform Navigator URL and password. Let's do it! Back to the OpenShift Web Console, open **Workloads** (A) and **Secrets** (B) again.
