However, the goals and objectives for this virtual event remain the same.\n\n  - Develop keeper skills and knowledge in the IBM Integration portfolio to effectively plan, Configure and run a client facing PoC / MVP activity.\n  - Develop skills and knowledge that can be sued to demonstrate IBMs marketplace differentiations in agile integration and cloud-native development using IBM Integration an RHOCP capabilities (GitOps Automation).\n  - Develop skills that can be used to demonstrate IBMs market differentiation in the Event Driven Architecture (EDA) domain.  Including development skill for creating and EDA-based MVP solution.\n\nAttendees will develop deeper skill in the following key focus areas and technologies; CP4i / RHOCP architecture & sizing, IBM Event Streams, Kafka, RH GitOps & RH Pipeline Operators, ArgoCD, and more.\n\n\n***\n\n## APAC SKO Virtual Tech Academy Format\n\n  - Planning for three (3) full days of content.  Each day being 6 hrs. long (plus a 1-hour lunch break), 18 hours of total content.\n\n  - APAC Tech Leaders have agreed to September 20, 21 and 22 for delivery.  Scheduling is aligned to the Singapore time zone (SGT +8 GMT).\n\n  - Band Tech Sellers, Client Engineering, Client Success Managers, Partner Tech Sellers, Partners.  Top head count around 50 attendees.\n\n  - Assign attendees into team of two (2) paired programing experience on labs and workshops.\n\n  - Attempt to assign students based on skill and experience levels.  Pair senior/experiences individuals w/ our junior attendees.\n\n  - We will need to provide a list of pre-work assignments.\n\n  - Each session will be a mix of presentation and hands-on lab or exercise work.  This hands-on work may (could) be defined as homework assignments.\n\n  - Begin the new next day with a review and Q&A from the prior day topics and exercise work.\n\n  - WW Time Zone Alignment & Session Scheduling.\n\n\n***\n\n## Agenda\n\n  - [Agenda](/gitops/labdetailed/)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"fed7dc2a658a7c2e247e763397b28c56","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":146},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview & Agenda"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Overview & Agenda\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Slack</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>What is the APAC SKO Virtual Tech Academy?</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>APAC SKO Virtual Tech Academy Format</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Agenda</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n***\n\n## Slack\n\n**Slack channel**: #sko-techacademy-integration-apac\n\n**Join slack channel here**: [https://ibm-technology-sales.slack.com/archives/C041RNAEGNQ](https://ibm-technology-sales.slack.com/archives/C041RNAEGNQ)\n\n***\n\n## What is the APAC SKO Virtual Tech Academy?\n\nThe APAC SKO Virtual Tech Academy is a virtual event that is replacing the originally planned, face-to-fact, AKO Technical Academy event.
